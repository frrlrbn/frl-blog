it is often said that valentine day is a day for the world to celebrate love. but for me, february 14th holds a much heavier, more beautiful weight, it is our day. exactly two years ago when i confess my love to you, my life changed in a way i didn't expect but desperately needed. it's funny how the universe works, giving me the greatest gift of my life on the day dedicated to love itself... these past 730 days have been about discovering what it truly means to care for someone else more than myself.

two years, kinda felt like it's not really a long time, but when i look back at us, it feels like a lifetime of memories. through every laugh and every challenge, you have been my constant, you've taught me patience, you've shown me kindness, and you've made the world feel a little less chaotic just by being in it. sweetheart, you aren't just my girlfriend.. you are the reason my days start with hope and end with gratitude. you are the peace i return to and i really glad that i did <3

the last few months have kinda tested us, being miles apart hasn't been easy for me :( i miss your presence more than words can say. we may not be holding hands today but my heart is right there with you, i know this distance is just a temporary space between us. i am counting down the seconds until i can hug you again. Thank you for being strong with me, for always loving me, and for being my home, no matter how far away i am. happy 2nd anniversary and happy valentine's day jeliin.
you are and always will be my forever valentine 🤍
